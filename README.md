## Business Understanding 

A company is interested in creating a new movie studio to stay competitive,but they do not know anything about creating movies.

Our goal was to determine which movies are doing best at the box office and make three recommendations for our company to use when deciding what type of films to create

## Data
The data is IMDB, Box Office Mojo, Rotten Tomatoes, TheMovieDB and The Numbers. 

It includes production data and performance data. 

Data is from movies released between 2010 and 2019.


## Visualizations 




## Conclusion

-Film in the Sci-Fi Genre

-Film directed by Colin Trevorrow

-Fund a film around 150,000,000 to 200,000,000


## Next Steps 

-Look into older and newer movie data

-Look into data that shows popular Sci-Fi literature that hasn't been adapted yet
